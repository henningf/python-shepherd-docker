Shepherd dockerfile
===================

This is simply a dockerfile that builds shepherd from the shepherd git repo: https://github.com/ukwa/python-shepherd
It is mostly a clone of: https://github.com/ukwa/wren/blob/master/shepherd/Dockerfile, instead of adding from a local directory, it will get the config files from github.
